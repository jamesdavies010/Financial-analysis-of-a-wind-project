# Financial Valuation & Risk Analysis of a Wind Project

## Overview

This project conducts a **financial valuation and risk analysis** for a wind energy project, providing key insights into its investment prospects. It models revenue projections, cost structures, risk factors, and sensitivity analyses to support informed decision-making.

## Business value

Wind energy projects require significant capital investment and long-term financial planning. This analysis helps investors, financial analysts, and energy companies:

- Assess the **financial viability** of the wind project.
- Identify key **risk factors** and their impact on profitability.
- Evaluate multiple **scenarios** to optimise investment decisions.
- Support strategic decision-making for sustainable energy investments.

## Features & methodology

### 1. Financial modelling

- **Revenue estimation** based on energy production and market prices.
- **Cost modelling** including capital expenditure (CAPEX), operational costs (OPEX), and maintenance.
- **Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE), and Payback Period** calculations.

### 2. Risk analysis

- Identification of **critical financial risks** (e.g., price fluctuations, operational inefficiencies).
- **Tornado analysis** and **multi-factor sensitivity analysis** to measure the impact of key variables on project profitability.
- **Scenario analysis** showing base case, better-case and worse-case projections.

## Key financial insights

- **Investment Feasibility**: The project's post-tax NPV in the base case is **£8.75M**, indicating a profitable investment.
- **IRR Analysis**: The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 15%**, surpassing typical hurdle rates for renewable energy investments.
- **Profitability Index (ROI)**: Achieves a **68% ROI** under base conditions, demonstrating strong returns.
- **Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE)**: The project yields an LCOE of **£44.31/MWh**, providing a competitive cost structure for energy generation.

## Sensitivity analysis & risk impact

### Tornado analysis

The project's **NPV is highly sensitive to**:

- **Electricity price (£/MWh)**: The most influential factor. A 50% drop leads to a negative NPV, while a 50% increase significantly boosts profitability.
- **Capacity factor**: Higher turbine efficiency improves NPV. Optimising turbine placement and technology upgrades can significantly increase profitability.
- **Discount rate**: Higher discount rates reduce NPV considerably, highlighting the importance of securing low-cost financing.
- **Operational xxpenditure (OpEx)**: While cost control improves financial viability, excessive reductions in OpEx should not come at the expense of turbine performance and reliability.
- **Inflation**: Moderate impact, with higher inflation slightly improving NPV due to potential price adjustments. Long-term contracts that allow pricing flexibility may provide financial stability.
- **Number of turbines**: Increasing the number of turbines directly scales profitability, indicating strong returns on expansion.
- **Turbine lifetime**: Longer turbine lifespans slightly increase NPV, though this is a secondary driver of profitability.
- **Project delays**: Delays before turbines start generating revenue significantly reduce NPV. Streamlining permitting, supply chain, and construction processes can help mitigate these risks.

### Multi-factor sensitivity analysis

- **Electricity price vs. Discount rate**: At £45/MWh, the project remains viable across all discount rates (4%–12%). If discount rates exceed 10%, prices must be at least £45/MWh for viability.
- **Electricity price vs. Capacity factor**: At £45/MWh, the project is viable with a minimum **27% capacity factor**. If electricity prices fall to £37.5/MWh, a **33% capacity factor** is needed. At £25/MWh, the project becomes unviable regardless of efficiency.
- **Electricity price vs. Years before operation**: At £45/MWh, the project remains viable even with up to **9 years of delays**. If prices fall to **£37.5/MWh, turbines must be operational within 5 years** to stay profitable. At £25/MWh, the project is unviable regardless of delays.

### Scenario analysis

A comparison of financial outcomes under different economic conditions:

- **Worse-case scenario**: A drop in electricity price and economic downturn leads to **£5.92M post-tax NPV, 11% IRR, and 46% ROI**.
- **Base-case scenario**: Assumes stable electricity prices, resulting in **£8.75M post-tax NPV, 15% IRR, and 68% ROI**.
- **Better-case scenario**: Higher electricity prices and economic growth increase NPV to **£9.80M, with 16% IRR and 77% ROI**.

## Cash flow analysis

- **Break-even analysis**: The project achieves payback in approximately **8-11 years**.
- **Net cash flow growth**: Positive post-tax cash flows accelerate after initial CAPEX recovery, ensuring sustainable long-term returns.

## How to use

1. **Download the project files**.
2. **Modify input assumptions** (costs, revenue, risk factors) in the `Input Data` sheet.
3. **Review key outputs** in the `Dashboard` for financial insights.
4. **Analyse risk & scenarios** using the `Further Analysis` and `Calculations` sheets.

## Ideal use cases

- Renewable energy investment assessments.
